    <h1>My Dearest,</h1>
    <p>Hey, so i just had this random urge to write you this little letter because, why not? So like yk, ever since that one night of April, you've become that one part of my daily routine which I never wanna skip. My day starts with a thought of you and ends with the same. Like, what did you to do to me babe? Kala jadu kori dila ne ki? But ji e korila, I crave more of it, I repeat, I CRAVE MORE OF IT.</p>
    <p>I crave every part of you, the pretty ones, the broken ones, the beautiful ones, but mostly, the part of you which you never show to anyone. I wanna be someone whom you can share anything and everything with. I want to be an escape for you when the world feels too much. Because that's what you are to me. You healed me in ways i didn't even know I needed healing and you're still doing it.</p>
    <p>I didn't know what I did to deserve you but whatever it is, THANK GOD I did it. I love you, babe. I literally love you so so much. Stick by my side till the end of eternity. Stick by me till the last of infinity. Stay. I love you.</p>
